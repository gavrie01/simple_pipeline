**Hi everyone!**
Within the repo you can find a simple simulation of a pipeline.
To demonstrate the case I used python's dlt library, it is free open source.
Please find the description and the flow in Jupyter Notebook, feel free to play and clone!
It is created for demonstration purpose!

In case you have an advise please do not hesitate to contact me!
